# Swell

A shell written in swift for personal learnings.

Swell is a passion project and a necessity, I am a full time DevOps engineer, scripts are my bread and butter, so having a robust programming suite that I can feel comfortable solving the mirriad of issues I have, is my objective with this project.

I am also looking to delight, to provide a feature rich, beautiful out of the box experience. This Shell aims to have a POSIX compliant mode, switchable via (tbd) and then an alternative mode that allows for cleaner procedural syntax.
