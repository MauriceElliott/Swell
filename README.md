# Swell

A shell written in swift.

My intent with Swell is to make a scripting language I can use and enjoy for daily DevOps needs. Using Swift as the basis for the syntax, which takes a lot of stylistic choices from C and Pascal, as well as a lot of mordern improvements, we will be aiming to implement a simple procedural language for interacting with API endpoints, chaining together command line tools and utilising modern facilities provided by up to date terminal emulators.

This is of course a purely personal project for my own enjoyment, however if I see marginal interest in the editor I will start design some guidelines around contributions as I do like the idea of this being a bit of a community effort, and seeing as I working towards having a good long term structure for the project, I think it'll be a nice one to contribute too.

Swell shell as I like to think of it takes influences from the my daily work, I do DevOps for a day job, and while I do that job, I drink a lot of tea. The name Swell comes from Swift and Shell, and Swell in Bri'ish means good, i.e. "Swell weather we're having today old chap!". For this reason alone, I want swell to be tea themed as it makes up a large part of my day and feels right.
